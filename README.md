# Additional Resources for CMT122: Machine Learning for NLP students (Autumn 2024-2025 Cardiff University)

The course is mandatory for the NLP Master's students and elective for other Master's programs. It was taught by [Jose Camacho-Collados](https://www.josecamachocollados.com) and myself ([Nedjma Ousidhoum](http://nedjmaou.github.io): module leader).

This class provides a basic understanding of Machine Learning methods with (mostly) practical tips and hands-on experience in ML to solve NLP problems, and a bit of theory.
 
As we had a diverse cohort with various familiarity levels with programming and students coming from several backgrounds (e.g., linguistics, languages, statistics, math, computer science,...), we also provided the students with resources for beginners. The compiled list includes courses, blogposts, videos, and research papers sorted by themes.
